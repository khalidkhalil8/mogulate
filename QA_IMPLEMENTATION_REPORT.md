## Security Notice
⚠️ **Security Warning**: One minor warning detected about leaked password protection being disabled. This is a configuration setting that doesn't affect core functionality but should be addressed for production security.

## Next Steps Required
1. Test end-to-end project creation flow
2. Verify feature persistence in normalized tables
3. Confirm all rerun restrictions are working
4. Address the password protection security setting
